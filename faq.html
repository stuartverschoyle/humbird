									<h3 class="major">What is FPV?</h3>
									<p>FPV or First Person View is a camera and transmission technology that enables operators to see in real time what the camera sees. FPV became very popular within the drone racing community and has recently made its way into the corporate business industry. We use a series of drones and other tools to give you a unique virtual experience of your property or business.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Why would FPV benefit me?</h3>
									<p>Traditional methods of showing off a property or business are effective, but do not give a true perspective of what it is like to tour the space. Typical drone footage can display beautiful aerial views of the roofs and landscapes from many yards away. FPV technology presents the ability to tour outside AND inside a location in a continuous shot or close to it in a matter of minutes. </p>
									<p>In Real Estate, Matterpoint 360 cameras are widely used for virtual tours. Unfortunately, they are an overall hassle to navigate and take much more time to fully cover a property. Home buying is supposed to be an enjoyable process. </p>
									<p><a href="services.html">Our FPV fly through experience</a> provides a jaw-dropping cinematic tour of a property from a truly unique perspective in just a few minutes. Your Business can benefit from FPV too. Want to show your customers what you have to offer? We can take a stunning continuous shot of your business from the outside in and inside out. We also recognize that safety is a big concern these days and this technology allows you to showcase that your business is taking every safety precaution. Take a look at our <a href="showreel.html">showreel</a> and witness our capabilities.​</p>

									<h3 class="major">HOW is it done?</h3>
									<p>When it comes to our industry, bigger is not always better. We utilize light weight custom built drones, small video cameras, tiny gimbals and much more to deliver that jaw dropping continues shot you see in our <a href="showreel.html">showreel</a>. On top of that, you will have the finished product to show your clients and customers in in less than 72 hours. Anything that you can imagine we can make it for you!</p>


									<h3 class="major">WHO is Humbird Visuals?</h3>
